                Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as small as four feet long and about 60
                pounds (the sun bear) to as big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear).
                They're found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.

                Butterflies are winged insects from the lepidopteran suborder Rhopalocera, characterized by large, often
                brightly coloured wings that often fold together when at rest, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight.

                Flamingos or flamingoes are a type of wading bird in the family Phoenicopteridae, which is the only
                extant
                family in the order Phoenicopteriformes. There are four flamingo species distributed throughout the
                Americas, and two species native to Afro-Eurasia. A group of flamingoes is called a "flamboyance".

                The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living
                terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as
                one
                species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.

                Turtles are reptiles of the order Testudines, characterized by a special shell developed mainly from
                their
                ribs. Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the Pleurodira and Cryptodira, which differ in
                the
                way the head retracts.
